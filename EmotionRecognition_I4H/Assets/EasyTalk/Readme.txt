The documentation is in the EasyTalkDocumention.pdf file bundled with this
asset.

Recording and playback are performed within the Unity editor, however, you 
still need to download the EasyTalk application from http://www.realtimevr.com/
in order to create the lip synced sequences. This download is free!
